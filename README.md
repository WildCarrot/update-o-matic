# update-o-matic

I wanted a single, cross-platform way to say "Apply all updates in a reasonably
safe and sane manner". Over the years, I've written scripts for most of the
operating systems that I run at home. This is an effort to merge them into
one script that can be pulled down and run from any OS that supports bash.

## Supported Operating Systems
* Linux variants
  * Fedora
  * Ubuntu
* Darwin (a.k.a. OS X)
