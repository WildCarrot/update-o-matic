# update-o-matic

I wanted a single, cross-platform way to say "Apply all updates in a reasonably
safe and sane manner". Over the years, I've written scripts for most of the
operating systems that I run at home. This is an effort to merge them into
one script that can be pulled down and run from any OS that supports bash.

At the moment the Linux scripts automatically reboot after updating and the
Darwin script does not. 

## Supported Operating Systems
* Linux variants
  * Fedora
  * Ubuntu
* Darwin (a.k.a. OS X)
  * with or without Macports
